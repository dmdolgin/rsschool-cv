## About me
I'm 25 years old. I have professional education - a lawyer.

Back in school, I was fond of IT technologies and development. With friends, we opened and supported a pirate server of MMORPG games. It was my best work experience ever.

Now I decided to return to the IT specialty and try myself in the frontend. I expect that after graduating from the RS School, my knowledge and skills will be enough to get a job Frontend Developer.
